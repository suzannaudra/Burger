# Burger
This is a burger log using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern;  Node and MySQL are used to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.


Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.


Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.


This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
This site is deployed using Heroku.
